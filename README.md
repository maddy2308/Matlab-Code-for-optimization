Matlab-Code-for-optimization
============================
This code helps in modelling the Data Center Items (Racks, Cracks , Perforated Floor Tiles, Power Display Units(PDU) 
and Batter Cabinets). Since the model is following OO principles it makes it more robust and more reusable. It also has 
the XML read and mapping the objects in 2-d plane once the XML is parsed.
